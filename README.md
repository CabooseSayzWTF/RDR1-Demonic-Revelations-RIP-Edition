RDR1 Demonic Revelations Mod Menu Source Code.
PS3 Untested source now added.

STORY TIME
- The reason all these sources was released was mostly due to the fact people were threatening my life, people were trying to dox me, people were trying to ddos me, people were decompiling the menu and stealing code, people were leaking menu code into the wild. The reason the menu even has some rather bad options is due to the fact this game was getting bad with toxic people so we had to handle them the best we could and we kept the game under lock and key and safe for awhile because r-star would not step in and do something. We had protections from people abusing stuff etc then the original menu creator decided it best to start adding freeze methods and all this stuff that was out of my control, by the time I took over the project it was too late to take it all out. I mean I easily could have but it was already out there so what was the point. Towards the end of it all I grew to hate this game and the community around it, people leaking code and threatening me was the last straw so I released these sources and left the game mostly for good. The game is a toxic wasteland now and you have those toxic people to blame, not me. I did my part with the help of others, we had ways to battle these toxic players, we had protections from these toxic players then they took it too far when they started to try doxing me and threatening my safety. Don't worry i'm good now. All those people's accs are long deleted or banned and they have not bothered me anymore since I open sourced these projects. This is why these projects are open sourced with what they have otherwise this menu would of been open-sourced with ALOT of the menu removed as is for Emulator use only. I'm not the bad guy here and never have been, It was either continue dealing with the daily threats from the numerous random accs adding me daily, finding ways into the servers I was in, deal with the stress and the anxeity of it all or release the source taking the easy way out. I chose the easy way out.
